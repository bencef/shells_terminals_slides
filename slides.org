* Punched Cards
  Punched cards were first used for looms.

  Used in early computers to enter text.
* Punched Cards
  That was one line:

  - Every column a character
  - Every row a bit

  And this is why still to this day lines are 80 columns long.
* Teletypes
  Machines using paper feed.

  Editing was line by line.

  The origin of the name =/dev/tty=.
* Teletypes

  With a single dot.

  (good luck if you want to *insert* a single dot on a line)
* Teletypes

  some uses today.  For example in shell scripts because it consumes
  commands as a text stream.
